Load testing
is thus an important practice for making sure a web site
meets those demands and for optimizing its different components

a convincing performance
test must include a test of the full application under
realistic loading conditions

In [16] it is recommended that
load testing of a web site should be performed on a regular
basis in order to make sure that IT infrastructure is provisioned
adequately, particularly with regard to changing user
behaviour and web site evolution.

Most current tools for load
testing support the creation of simple test cases consisting
of a fixed sequence of operations. However, in order to give
the generated load some variety it is usually necessary to
modify and parametrize these test cases manually. This is
usually both time-consuming and difficult. A more elaborate
approach is needed in order to generate a realistic load,
and such an approach requires more advanced tool support.

Our approach applies the methodology of form-oriented
analysis [9], in which user interaction with a submit/
response style system is modelled as a bipartite state
transition diagram.

Form didn't exist = 0, Only one form = one
Pform:Histories × Forms → [0, 1]
Once a form is chosen, we estimate a delay. This is done
with pdelay. Time is a continuous variable, therefore pdelay
is not a discrete probability distribution but a probability
density function.
pdelay:Histories × Forms × (0,∞) → R+
Data is the universe
of possible data, and if some particular data in it cannot be
entered into a form, the value of Pinput is 0.
Pinput:Histories × Forms × Data → [0, 1]

But we can also exploit real user
data in order to find suitable parameters for a stochastic
model. A stochastic model is a more general approach and
therefore more versatile. It is much easier to create new
load testing scenarios by adjusting model parameters.

Furthermore, replaying recorded data might not cause a system
load that is representative.

We need this recurrence to states in order to handle cycles in
the original formchart, which could not be represented with
a finite decision tree otherwise.

The parameters that can
be used to describe a workload are explained in Sect. 5
It is important that the load test environment the system is
running in is very close to the production environment
the one the system is eventually intended to work in.

In many cases, load-testing is still done by hand-written
scripts that describe the user model as a subprogram

For each virtual user, the subprogram is called, possibly
with a set of parameters that describe certain aspects of
the virtual user’s behaviour

Data is either taken from a set of predefined
values or generated randomly. With regard to input data
this approach has a certain degree of randomization. However,
user behaviour itself mainly remains a matter of repetition.
This approach is purely script driven and suffers,
like any hand-written program, from being prone to programming
errors.

The leading product for industry-strength load testing
[19] is Mercury Interactive’s LoadRunner [17].

It takes a similar script-driven approach. However, it significantly
increases usability by offering a visual editor for end-user scripts.
