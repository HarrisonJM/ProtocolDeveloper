Load Testing of Web Sites
Daniel A. Menascé

QoS Measures
QoS is key to assessing how well Web-based applications
meet customer expectations on two primary
measures: availability and response time.

Availability
Availability measures the percentage of time customers
can access a Web-based application. Availability
goals typically vary according to the application
type. Critical applications, such as online
brokerage, often have more stringent requirements
than other applications, such as online travel sites.
However, even in industries where availability is
less critical, it is always crucial to a company’s
bottom line.

Response Time
Another key QoS factor for Web and e-commerce
sites is response time With Web-based environments,
you must measure end-to-end response
time to determine how customers perceive such
things as page download and keyword search
times. Also, when defining end-to-end response
time, you must distinguish between the download
time for the base HTML page and that for other
page components, such as images and ad banners.

Clearly, measuring response time from a single geo-
graphical location and specific time window will
not give you a complete picture. End-to-end
response time is time- and space-dependent, and
you must know how users from different locations,
with different connectivity, perceive your site’s performance
at different times of day.

A load test is
valid only if virtual users’ behavior has characteristics
similar to those of actual users. You must
therefore ensure that your virtual users
 follow patterns similar to real users,
 use realistic think times, and
 react like frustrated users, abandoning a Web
session if response time is excessive.
