Automatic Stress and Load Testing for Embedded Systems
Mohamad S. Bayan Jo˜ao W. Cangussu

Load Testing [4, 5] assesses how a system performs under
a given ”load.” The rate at which transactions are submitted
to the system is called the Load

It reveals programming
errors that would not appear if the system executes with a
small/limited workload. Such errors are called Load sensitive
faults and emerge when the system is executed under a
heavy load.

Stress Testing [3, 4, 5] refers to subject a system
to an unreasonable load with the intention of breaking it.
