Simulating Realistic Network Worm Traffic for Worm Warning System Design and Testing
Michael Liljenstam David M. Nicol Vincent H. Berk Robert S. Gray

For the worm simulation, our starting point is the SSFNet
simulator [2][9], a packet-level network simulator written in
Java that supports parallel and distributed execution for in-
creased scalability. It includes standard TCP/IP protocols
25
(IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, ...) and detailed implemen-
tations of routing protocols such as BGP and OSPFv2.

We evaluated the performance of DIBS/TRAFEN by run-
ning simulations with varying degrees of router participa-
tion, feeding the simulated ICMP-T3 Unreachable trac
into the working DIBS/TRAFEN prototype, and measuring
how many simulated machines were infected at the time that
DIBS/TRAFEN detected the propagating worm.
