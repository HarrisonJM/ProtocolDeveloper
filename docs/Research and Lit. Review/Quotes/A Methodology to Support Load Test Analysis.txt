A Methodology to Support Load Test Analysis

We formulate our problem statement by highlighting the current
challenges and threats faced by performance analysts during load
test analysis of ULSS.

Load test is characterized by multiple factors: Workload,
environment (hardware resources, software version etc., status
(pass/fail), high-level metrics (response time, throughput, latency
etc.,).Workload has two dimensions: a characteristics and
intensity. The characteristics of a workload refer to attributes like
read/write ratio and arrival distribution. The intensity of a
workload refers to attributes such as the arrival rate of the
operations and throughput of data read. The test report contains all
load test factors.
