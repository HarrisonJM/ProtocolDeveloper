However, based on the observations of a system’s
behavior when executing in a specific environment, a model can
be dynamically customized for this scenario.

Figure 1 presents our proposed approach’s general structure. The
approach has three major components:“Input Identification,” “Controller
Tuning,” and “Controller.” The first identifies the inputs that
affect the resources of interest. The “Controller Tuning”, which is
outside the scope of this paper, automatically computes the internal
parameters of the chosen controller. Given an initial test case,
the “Controller” computes the sequence of test cases to drive the
resource of interested to the desired load/stress level. Description
of the two blocks addressed here are given next.
