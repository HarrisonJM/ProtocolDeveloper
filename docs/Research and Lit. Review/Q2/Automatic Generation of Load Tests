Load tests aim to validate whether a systemâ€™s performance (e.g., response time, resource utilization) is acceptable under production, projected, or extreme loads (Zhang et al, 2011).

Existing approaches to generate load tests induce load by increasing the input size (e.g., a larger query or number of queries) or the rate at which input is provided (e.g., more query requests per unit of time) (Zhang et al, 2011).

Current approaches to load testing suffer from four limitations. First, their cost-effectiveness is highly dependent on the particular values that are used yet there is no support for choosing those values (Zhang et al, 2011).

Second, increasing the input size may be a costly means to load a system. For example, in the context of a compression application we studied, we found that to increase the response (Zhang et al, 2011).

Third, increasing the input size may just force the system to perform more of the same computation (Zhang et al, 2011).

Finally, while most load testing focuses on response time or system throughput, there are many other resource consumption measures that are of interest to developers (Zhang et al, 2011).
