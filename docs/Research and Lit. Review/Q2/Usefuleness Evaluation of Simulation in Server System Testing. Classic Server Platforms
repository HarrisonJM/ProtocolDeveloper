(Sun & Männistö, 2012)

The study found that simulation was used on almost every interface to external systems, and two factors that affected the usefulness of simulators over long term were the functionality supported and the applicable usage scenarios (Sun & Männistö, 2012).

Simulation has a long history of usage in the system verification and validation (Sun & Männistö, 2012).

At the same time, simulation requires investments in terms of time, staff and materials, etc (Sun & Männistö, 2012).

Müller et el. wrote on the usefulness and importance of simulation in support of software engineering (Sun & Männistö, 2012).
