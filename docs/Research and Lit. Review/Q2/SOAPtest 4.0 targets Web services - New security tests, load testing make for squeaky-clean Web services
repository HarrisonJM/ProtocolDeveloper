Parasoft's SOAPtest is one of a growing number of tools that test these increasingly critical applications. (Grehan, 2005)

SOAPtest delivers comprehensive regression, unit, and security testing for Web services and Web service client applications (Grehan, 2005).

This is SOAPtest's real power. Beginning with a small, simple set of static and dynamic tests automatically generated by a wizard (one of the new features of SOAPtest 4.0), you can extend, duplicate, and modify those tests to build -- Lego-style -- an increasingly powerful suite (Grehan, 2005).
