 * THE WAY IT WORKS IS:
 *
 * Test handler will request data generation from protocol
 * Testcase will request data
 * Testcase will pass data to comms ahndler to be sent
 * Comms handler will pass information back to the test
 * the test will pass it to the protocol to be decode (And it be returned)
 * Finally the test will log what the result was
