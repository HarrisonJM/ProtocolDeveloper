The Hello\+Goodbye server will deal in and serve the purposes of testing the Prot\+Dev The protocol is defined as sending Hello or goodbye (dependent on receiving the opposite response) in a variety of interpretable ways.

A simple Hello World server. Will send Hello/goodbye world depending on what it receives. Will be used to help develop and test different features of the prot dev program

Listen function that will listen for connections, spawn a thread when a connection is made A function that sends information back away and then dies Might be worth implementing a simple kill\+Server command

\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{todo__todo000001}{Todo}}]Increase complexity for more tests 

Add more configurations 

Reap children (The harvest is small) 

Tidy up (remove singletons and probably more)\end{DoxyRefDesc}
